## Bio

Since my B.S in Agronomy and Crop Sciences to my P.hD. in Quantitative Genetics and Plant Breeding, I've been working on mathematical models capable to describe how plants respond to changes in their environment in terms of plasticity and adaptation. I study quantitative genetics models capable to predict and analyze complex plant traits, integrating multiple data types such as phenomics, genomics, weather and soil information, remote sensing, satellite-based data (GIS), and ecophysiology models. By combining my knowledge with other fields like biometrics, computational biology, experimental statistics, and breeding, I aim to help plant scientists address society's growing demands for a sustainable, productive, and resource-efficient agricultural system.

Right now, I'm serving as a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University, which focuses on evolutionary allele mining, gene discovery, and GxE modeling for maize genetics (check out [Buckler's Lab webpage](https://www.maizegenetics.net/)).
