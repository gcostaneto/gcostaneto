## Personal Profile


- I‚Äôm currently working on the interplay between large-scale envirotyping (shortly, enviromics)
and Quantitative Genetics for purposes of Predictive Breeding.
- Creator and maintainer of the [EnvRtype package](ttps://github.com/allogamous/EnvRtype/blob/master/README.md)

Ph.D. candidate interested in prediction-based tools for crop improvement. I‚Äôm passionate about biometrics underlying phenomics, enviromics, and quantitative genetics for multiple environments. In the last 8 years, I have been improving myself in this field in which I believe is my way to contribute to the development of sustainable and climate-smart agriculture. I hope to take the next steps towards joining a solid biostatistics team in the global seed industry or in the public sector. I visualize my personal profile in the following mission and values:

-	Science thinking for quality improvement in agricultural research in an environmental-safe way;
-	Search for research gaps to be filled and solved in genomic-based selection for staple-food crops;
-	Focus on anticipating problems, learning and applying cutting-edge technologies and dealing with multidisciplinary tasks.
